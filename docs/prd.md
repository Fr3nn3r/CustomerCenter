# Customer Center - Backend System PRD

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for the Customer Center backend system. The system is designed to empower users, such as Sales Managers and their clients, to efficiently manage and execute client acquisition campaigns, primarily through cold email outreach. It aims to provide tools for lead generation, AI-driven email personalization, campaign execution, and performance tracking, all within a multi-tenant architecture.

## 2. Goals

*   **Enable Effective Outreach:** Allow users to run targeted and personalized cold email campaigns at scale.
*   **Automate Key Processes:** Streamline lead validation, email content preparation (via AI, managed by application logic), and aspects of campaign execution.
*   **Provide Actionable Insights:** Offer tracking of individual email statuses and overall campaign performance KPIs.
*   **Support Multiple Clients:** Implement a robust multi-tenant system to serve various customers securely and independently.
*   **Facilitate Integration:** Design the system to easily integrate with automation platforms like n8n for scraping, email sending, and other workflows.

## 3. Target Users

*   **Sales Managers:** Individuals using the system to run campaigns for their own organization or for multiple clients.
*   **Client Companies:** Businesses utilizing the platform (potentially managed by a Sales Manager or directly) to generate leads and manage their outreach.

## 4. High-Level Requirements

The system must fulfill the following core requirements:

*   **R1: Multi-Tenancy:** The system must support multiple tenants (customers/accounts), ensuring strict data isolation between them.
*   **R2: User Management:** Each tenant can have multiple users with defined roles (e.g., admin, manager).
*   **R3: Campaign Management:** Users can create, configure, and manage outreach campaigns.
*   **R4: Lead Acquisition & Management:**
    *   System must be able to store and manage large volumes of leads (1000+ per campaign).
    *   System must track lead validation status.
    *   Duplicate leads across different campaigns for the same or different tenants are permissible. The same lead information can exist multiple times if sourced for different campaign contexts.
*   **R5: Email Personalization (Application Layer):** While the database stores the final content, the logic for AI-driven email personalization for each lead will be handled by the application layer (e.g., n8n or a custom service).
*   **R6: Campaign Execution (Application Layer):** The sending of emails according to a schedule will be orchestrated by the application layer. The database will store scheduling information and track send status.
*   **R7: Outreach Tracking:** The system must track the status of each individual email sent (e.g., scheduled, sent, delivered, opened, clicked, bounced).
*   **R8: Performance KPIs:** The system must store data necessary to calculate key performance indicators for each campaign (e.g., response rate, positive response rate).
*   **R9: Email Reply Handling:**
    *   The system must store incoming email replies.
    *   Replies should be classifiable (e.g., using AI, handled by the application layer) and this classification stored.
*   **R10: Follow-up Emails:** The system must support the concept of follow-up email sequences, with the content and timing managed by the application layer.

## 5. Key Features (Derived from Requirements)

*   **Tenant Onboarding & Management:** Secure creation and management of tenant accounts.
*   **Tenant-Specific API Key Management:** Allowing tenants to integrate their own tools (like n8n) securely.
*   **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure login and role-based access control within each tenant.
*   **Campaign Configuration:** Defining campaign names, descriptions, and settings (e.g., parameters for AI, scheduling hints for the application layer).
*   **Lead List Management:** Importing, storing, and associating leads with specific campaigns and tenants.
*   **Outbound Email Logging:** Storing details of every email intended for sending, including its AI-personalized content, scheduled time, and actual send status.
*   **Email Interaction Tracking:** Capturing events like email opens and clicks (requires integration with an email service provider that supports this).
*   **Reply Ingestion & Categorization:** Storing received email replies and their associated AI-driven classification.
*   **Basic Analytics & Reporting Data:** Providing the raw data needed to calculate campaign KPIs.

## 6. Success Metrics (Examples)

*   Number of active tenants and users.
*   Volume of leads processed and emails sent.
*   Average campaign response rates and positive response rates.
*   System uptime and API responsiveness.
*   Ease of integration reported by users leveraging n8n or APIs.

## 7. Future Considerations

*   Advanced, configurable scheduling logic directly within the platform.
*   More sophisticated built-in analytics dashboards.
*   Integration with a wider range of email service providers and CRM systems.
*   Support for other outreach channels beyond email.
